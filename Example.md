Okay, the user is asking for the weather and time in Sydney. Let me check the tools available. There's get_weather for weather and get_datetime for current date and time. Since the previous response didn't have any info, maybe the document_qa_system is needed? But the user didn't mention a document. Wait, the instructions say to use the document_qa_system only when needed for the local PDF document. Since there's no mention of a document, maybe I should use get_weather and get_datetime directly.

Wait, the user's question is about Sydney's weather and time. The get_weather tool requires the city name. So I should call get_weather with Sydney. Then get_datetime with Sydney. But the previous response said the context didn't have info, maybe because the document wasn't available. But the user is asking now, so I need to use the tools. Let me try both tools.

First, check if the document_qa_system is needed. The user's question isn't about a specific document, so probably not. So use get_weather and get_datetime. Let me proceed.
